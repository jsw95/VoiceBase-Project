Code and report for a information extraction task

Group project during first term of the MSc Data Analytics. Task was to extract soccial security numbers from a transcript of voice recordings. My personal contribution was using a Support Vector Machine on a sliding window of words in the conversation to accurately predict whether a SSN was present.
